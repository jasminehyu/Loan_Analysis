# Loan Analysis Project
## Overview
This project analyzes loan applications in Wisconsin for the year 2020, focusing on patterns in lending practices. It aims to identify and address potential disparities in loan approvals and interest rates using publicly available data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HDMA).

Lending discrimination based on factors like race has a long history, and this analysis seeks to bring more transparency to such issues by examining various aspects of the loan applications. The analysis uses data structures, algorithms, and data science techniques to extract insights from a large dataset.
